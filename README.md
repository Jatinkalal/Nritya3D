# Nritya3D: Monocular Video-Driven Expressive 3D Human Mesh Reconstruction

## Accepted paper at Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI 2025)

## Introduction
This repository presents a work related to 3D human mesh reconstruction in the form of SMPL-X using single input video towards presenting classical Indian dance form Bharatanatyam in 3D.

## System Architecture
To be updated soon.
